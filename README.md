This is an application to fetch weather data from *NOAA* the National Oceanic 
and Athmospheric Administration. *NOAA* provides a webservice to fetch the 
data.

There is also a development notebook available which describes the steps 
developing the application with a test first approach [elixir.pdf](https://github.com/sugaryourcoffee/noaa/blob/master/notebook/elixir.pdf).

This application is the result of a challenge from *Dave Thomas*' book 
*Programming Elixir* that can be found at 
[pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir).
